To The Tune of The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire...)
Lyrics by Stompy the Destroyer

Soundtracks playing on the intercom
Score boards shining on the wall
Infosec geeks with their laptops in rows
Hope their castle’s last to fall

There in the conference hall
A free beer and some pretzel sticks
Helps to break the glassy gaze
Choose to brute force
Or a small script, of course
It must get done in just two days...

They know there’s challenge coins to win
And so they have their VMs ready to begin
And every little file gets analyzed
To see the easter eggs that were planted by Tim

And then we’ll wander to the hotel bar
To boast and have a drink or two
Lets raise a glass and exchange business cards,    
Happy NetWars To You
